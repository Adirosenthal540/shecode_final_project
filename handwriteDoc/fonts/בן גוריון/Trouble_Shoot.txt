Dear user,

This document describes a few notes for your attention when using MyFont software:

1. When pasting the text you want to convert, into the input box, make sure you are set to the right writing direction. 
Example: If you want to convert text in the English language, make sure you are set to left-to-right typing direction and not right-to-left. Pasting the text when you are set to the wrong direction may cause problems in the conversion.

2. If you see unknown characters in the output box after conversion, make sure you installed the font (TTF file) properly in the System Font directory.

3. If some of the characters of the converted text string aren't shown properly in Microsoft Word, send us email containig a short description of this problem and include your Windows and Microsoft Word versions. This can happen because of minor differences between Micsoroft software versions.

4. If you get an Error message says you don't have COMCTL32.OCX installed, all you have to do is copy COMCTL32.OCX file into c:\windows\system32 directory.

Please report us of any bugs or problems you encounter and we will do our best to fix them A.S.A.P!
